        We created a simple programming test to assess your knowledge and skill level. For this test you're required to built a simple web application, you need to build it with .Net c#.
    </p>
    <p>
        The web application must have two things, a create-read-update-list (CRUD) of carriers, and a CRUD of ratings for these carriers, remember to create a user and allow the carrier to be rate only once per user.
    </p>

        We need to run your project, so, you need to send instruction with your project explaining how we need to setup the database and install the dependencies to run the project. For this purpose a README.txt will do just fine. Put the code in GitHub.com and send us the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also whant to see if u can publish your own project, so we need u to create one website and publish your project in any server you whant (like Azure or AWS) and send us a link so we can access the "go-live" working version.
